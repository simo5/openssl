=head1 NAME

fips_config - OpenSSL FIPS configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is disabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The FIPS provider is
automatically loaded when the system is booted in FIPS mode, or when the
environment variable B<OPENSSL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE> is set. See the documentation
for more information.

=head1 HISTORY

This functionality was added in OpenSSL 3.0.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses a supplementary config for FIPS module located in
OpenSSL configuration directory and managed by crypto policies. If present, it
should have format

 [fips_sect]
 tls1-prf-ems-check = 0
 activate = 1

The B<tls1-prf-ems-check> option specifies whether FIPS module will require the
presence of extended master secret or not.

The B<activate> option enforces FIPS provider activation.
